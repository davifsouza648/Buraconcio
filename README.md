# Buraconcio

## About the Project

**Buraconcio** is a game developed by @ringass, @argArthur, @mukaimasao, and @davifsouza648 as part of an academic assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming subject in the Computer Science course at **UNESP â€“ Bauru**.

The project is built in **Java**, using the **LibGDX** and **Box2D** libraries. It applies various programming concepts learned in class, such as **sockets**, **threads**, and **object-oriented design**.

## The Game

Buraconcio is a **top-down golf-like game** where the maps evolve dynamically during gameplay. Inspired by _Ultimate Chicken Horse_, it allows players to freely place (or erase) obstacles between rounds, resulting in a chaotic and unpredictable environment.
