# Buraconcio

## About the Project

**Buraconcio** is a game developed by @ringass, @argArthur, @mukaimasao, and @davifsouza648 as part of an academic assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming subject in the Computer Science course at **UNESP â€“ Bauru**.

The project is built in **Java**, using the **LibGDX** and **Box2D** libraries. It applies various programming concepts learned in class, such as **sockets**, **threads**, and **object-oriented design**.

## The Game

Buraconcio is a **top-down golf-like game** where the maps evolve dynamically during gameplay. Inspired by _Ultimate Chicken Horse_, it allows players to freely place (or erase) obstacles between rounds, resulting in a chaotic and unpredictable environment.

## Server Screen
The Server Screen acts as a map manager and player organizer for the game, making everything easier to set up. Its design was inspired by Black Ops 2.

## Victory Screen

The victory screen isn't just a regular screen â€” it's an interactive space where you can control the balls and have fun with your friends.  
It works like a mini coliseum, with physics and gravity applied, since the screen itself is also a fully simulated world.

## Sounds

The game features a complete sound environment â€” including button click effects, background music in the lobby and server screens, and proximity-based obstacle sounds.  
Each obstacle has its own unique audio feedback, and every map includes an exclusive soundtrack to enhance the gameplay experience.
